# 2D-Tact-Shoot
2D Tactical Shooter Made in Unity3D Engine


Hello! and welcome to the 2D Tactical Shooter Development team. Sadly I won't use the cooler code name associated with the project to prevent
the possibility of legal issues later down the road ( the name was very copyrightish...). So, you wanna make a game huh? well, you've come to the right place.
Currently, i've created a fairly solid framework for us to start working on, we have dots that can move around in multiplayer and shoot shit at each other! Its pretty cool i'd say,
but exetremely basic. You should start by reading everything i type here, and then downloading the build and making sure it works (i never downloaded it, just uploaded... things go wroong sometimes.)
Read my code, i commented fairly well i'd say, and then go to this link to understand netcode even better: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetSetup.html This is what i used to make the framework. Once you understand things
Start tackling the TODO list i'll make somewhere on github in a sec, and slowely but surely, we'll have a wicked game.

PS: Don't share anything here with anyone! its spooky and secret

HOW TO WORK ON THE GAME:
1. Go to the wiki or issues tab and pick something to work on
2. Branch out from the main branch, specifically for that task you choose
3. Once you finish, make a pull request back to main, edit issues/wiki based on what you have accomplished
NOTE: DO NOT EVER MAKE PULL REQUEST IF YOU HAVE ERRORS THAT PREVENT THE GAME FROM BUILDING
NOTE: COMMENT EVERYTHING PROPERLY. follow the way I commmented the base code to see how to do it. UofT comp sci style. Pull requests will get rejected if your code cannot be understood because its not commented properly.
