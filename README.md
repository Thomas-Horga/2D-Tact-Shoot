# 2D-Tact-Shoot
2D Tactical Shooter Made in Unity3D Engine

Currently, there is a fairly solid framework to start working with, we have dots that can move around in multiplayer and shoot "bullets" at each other! Its pretty cool i'd say,
but extremely basic. You should start by reading everything i type here, and then downloading the build and making sure it works (i never downloaded it, just uploaded... things go wroong sometimes.)
Read the current code and then go to this link to understand netcode even better: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetSetup.html This is what i used to make the framework. Once you understand things
Start tackling the TODO list on the wiki.



HOW TO WORK ON THE GAME:  
1. Go to the wiki or issues tab and pick something to work on  
2. Branch out from the main branch, specifically for that task you choose  
3. Once you finish, make a pull request back to main, edit issues/wiki based on what you have accomplished  
NOTE: DO NOT EVER MAKE PULL REQUEST IF YOU HAVE ERRORS THAT PREVENT THE GAME FROM BUILDING  
NOTE: COMMENT EVERYTHING PROPERLY. follow the way I commmented the base code to see how to do it. UofT comp sci style. Pull requests will get rejected if your code cannot be understood because its not commented properly.
